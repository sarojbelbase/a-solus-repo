# A Solus Repository

Just another solus repository that tries.

## Available Packages

#### Visual Studio Code (Microsoft Version)

| Package Name | Version | Last Updated | Whats New?
|-|-|-|-|
| visual-studio-code | 1.54.1 | 6th March | [Changelogs](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/releases/tag/1.54.1) |

#### But Why?

This is a official binary distribution from [*Microsoft*](https://code.visualstudio.com/) made for [*Solus Distribution*](https://getsol.us/home/). The vscode available in the official Solus repository is an unofficial build made directly from the github. It's codenamed as `code-oss`. There are some proprietary features & APIs that are not accessible/available in that open-source version. Hence this package, with **unlimited power** for solus users.
