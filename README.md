# Visual Studio Code (Microsoft Version)

This is a official binary distribution from [*Microsoft*](https://code.visualstudio.com/) made for [*Solus Distribution*](https://getsol.us/home/).

## Details

Packaged Version: [1.50.0](https://github.com/sidbelbase/vscode-ms/releases/tag/1.50.0)


## But Why?

The vscode available in the official Solus repository is an unofficial build made directly from the github. It's codenamed as `code-oss`. There are some proprietary features & APIs that are not accessible/available in that open-source version. Hence this package, with **unlimited power** for solus users.
